### Technologies used: 
* React
* Node

### Approach Taken: 

I chose to re-create my first porfolio using React because it allows me to showcase the skills and tools I've learned along my coding journey. \

I have a solid understanding of React, and I am eager to continue and learn more. 

The website allows user's to view my LinkedIn, Github, and view my resume. Additionally, users can view my projects and learn more about me.
